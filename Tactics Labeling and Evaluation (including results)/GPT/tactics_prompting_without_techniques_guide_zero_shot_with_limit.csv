   ""Explanation"": ""The Snort rule is triggered by a specific User-Agent string known to be associated with malware, in this case, Elite Keylogger. This matches the technique where spearphishing might use emails with malicious attachments or links that appear normal but are controlled by the attacker. The rule's focus on a known malicious user-agent suggests monitoring for indicators tied to spearphishing attempts.""
