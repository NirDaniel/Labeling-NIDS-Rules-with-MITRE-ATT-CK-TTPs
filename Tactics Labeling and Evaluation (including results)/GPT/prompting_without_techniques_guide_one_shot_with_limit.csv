   ""Explanation"": ""The Snort rule detects an outbound communication attempt indicating data being sent to a server, likely representing data exfiltration or command and control activity common with malware, thereby aligning with technique T1105 where files are transferred into a network.""

   ""Quotes"": ""Adversaries may attempt to cause a server to authenticate to an adversary-controlled system over SMB or HTTP for the purpose of capturing credentials."",
   ""Explanation"": ""The Snort rule provided monitors SMB traffic and checks for specific patterns that suggest a 'Responder poisoner' SMB negotiation which is a classic example of the Forced Authentication technique where an adversary compels a device to authenticate to an adversary-controlled system, thereby capturing credentials sent over SMB.""

   ""Explanation"": ""The Snort rule detects an attempt to bypass the VBScript execution policy in Microsoft Internet Explorer 11. This tactic can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts or code on the target client machine via VBScript, often embedded in emails that could be processed by the SMTP protocol, given the rule concerns traffic to SMTP servers. This fits the method described in the technique where exploitation is used to run code on a client.""
